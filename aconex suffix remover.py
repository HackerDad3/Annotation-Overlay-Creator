    Removes the last underscore followed by 1â€“2 letters/numbers from the string.
    For example:
      - "filename_1" becomes "filename"
      - "myfile_ab" becomes "myfile"
      - "document_abc" remains "document_abc" since there are three characters after underscore
      - "report_9" becomes "report"
      - "report_99" becomes "report"
      - "data_!2" remains "data_!2" since '!' is not alphanumeric
    This should fix issues with _ within filenames
